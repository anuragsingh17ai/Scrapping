In 2023, the sale of EVs in Gujarat grew 28% at 88,619 vehicles compared to 68,997vehicles retailed in 2022. However, over three years, i.e., against 10,885 units retailed in 2021, EV sales in Gujarat have gone up by 714%. Driven by high demand and an ecosystem push in Gujarat, an increasing number of car #manufacturers are eyeing Gujarat for #investments while existing ones are looking to expand. The growing demand for EVs can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, there has been an improvement in charging infrastructure, making it more convenient for EV owners to recharge their #vehicles. Additionally, advancements in battery technologies have led to better performance and longer range, making EVs a more attractive option for consumers. Furthermore, government subsidies have helped reduce the cost of owning an EV, further boosting sales.‚úî To browse more Press Releases, visit - https://bit.ly/3NJSG9Q‚úî To learn about our services, visit : https://bit.ly/3CT73Ud‚úî For any customized market research & advisory requirements drop us a query at connect@eninrac.com#Eninrac #marketresearch #advisory #consulting #energy #power #GujaratEVs #ElectricVehicleGrowth #GujaratInvestments #EVManufacturing #SustainableGujarat #ChargingInfrastructure #BatteryTechnology #EVSubsidies #GreenMobility #GujaratDevelopment #CleanEnergyGujarat #FutureOfMobility

2024-05-10,"Understanding the Agreement for Sale under RERA In the realm of real estate, the Agreement for Sale plays a pivotal role, especially under the purview of RERA (Real Estate Regulation and Development Act). Let's delve into what this agreement entails and its significance in the context of RERA.What is an Agreement for Sale?An Agreement for Sale is a legal contract between the buyer and the seller (promoter/developer), outlining the transfer of property rights upon fulfillment of specified conditions. It delineates that property rights will be transferred to the buyer only after meeting the agreed-upon terms.Execution of Agreement for Sale under RERAAccording to Section 13 of RERA, a promoter cannot accept more than 10% of the property cost without first executing a written Agreement for Sale and registering it. This ensures transparency and safeguards the interests of both parties.Model Agreement: A Reference PointRERA provides a Model Agreement for Sale, serving as a guide for parties involved. Though not binding, it aids in preventing unfair terms. Recent cases reinforce the importance of adhering to the Model Agreement for legal clarity.Prospective vs. Retrospective ApplicationRERA's impact on existing agreements differs from new ones. While pre-RERA agreements remain valid, all future agreements must align with the Model Agreement, reflecting RERA's prospective approach.Registration: Mandatory or Not?The debate over the mandatory registration of Agreement for Sale persists. While RERA mandates registration, the Registration Act of 1908 presents a contrasting view. Clarity is essential to avoid legal ambiguities.Consequences of Non-RegistrationFailure to register the Agreement for Sale carries legal implications. It may not be admissible in court, and the promoter may lose certain rights over the property. Recent judgments emphasize the importance of adherence to registration requirements.ConclusionThe Agreement for Sale serves as a cornerstone in real estate transactions, particularly under RERA. Promoters must ensure timely execution and registration to mitigate future risks. Clarity regarding registration requirements is imperative for legal certainty.#RealEstate #RERA #LegalInsights #AgreementForSale #PropertyLaw #contracts #Agreements #drafting

2024-05-10,"üëâ Let's talk about Sponsored TV!It's a new ad type not widely explored by brands yet, probably due to its unique placement on Streaming TV.The ad type is primarily useful for brand awareness (top-of-funnel strategy) and tends to have a high ACOS but also can have a positive impact on metrics like organic sales, video completion rate (we saw over 90%), viewable impressions, and brand searches. These can therefore be useful metrics to look at to assess performance and impact.It's also more accessible than DSP with a minimum budget requirement of $20/day (recommended $150/day).This video shares more insights into this new Ad type, hopefully, provides with some valueable learnings to start trying it. Also, check out our recent case study and podcast (link in comments) üòé#amazon #sponsoredads #itsalwaysdayone

Export on an approval basis is a common practice in many industries where goods are exported from India say for the exhibitions, etc., and approval is obtained later for sale. When goods are exported, the transaction does not qualify as a supply because the export is not made against any consideration, and hence it does not qualify as zero-rated supply, as clarified in Circular No. 108/27/2019-GST dated 18.07.2019.The major issue in this circular was that it stated that when you export goods in this manner, where the sale is confirmed later, you cannot claim a refund under Rule 96. The circular only permitted refunds under section 54(3), i.e., refund of accumulated ITC.This condition was challenged before the Bombay High Court, where the HC didn't directly say that circular was wrong or contradictory, but rather stated that a refund claim could be made under Rule 96. The court held that if the petitioner had already fulfilled necessary requirements such as filing a shipping bill and paying IGST, they shouldn't be denied a refund simply due to data incompatibility between Customs and GST departments or because of issues with electronic portals under the GST regime. This judgment holds significant importance for many taxpayers. The concerned taxpayers may reassess their current approach to exporting goods. If opting for IGST payment proves to be more advantageous, they should consider filing appropriate representations to leverage the benefits of the judgment. Additionally, exploring other legal remedies is also advisable. Trust the above is helpful. ùêïùê¢ùêûùê∞ùê¨ ùêöùê´ùêû ùêúùê®ùê¶ùê©ùê•ùêûùê≠ùêûùê•ùê≤ ùê©ùêûùê´ùê¨ùê®ùêßùêöùê•. ThanksSunil Kumar
