Introducing Me My name is Meredith. My birthday is November 10, 1996. I live at home with my parents, Ellis and Thatcher and a dog and a cat in Medford. I am Protestant, but I do not actively participate in services. I enjoy celebrating the holidays. I enjoy going out into the community with my com hab staff. I am taking a theater class, cooking class and art class in person and I take a vocal class virtually. I like doing puzzles, reading and playing on my iPad. I am able to ambulate independently. I use the handrails going up and down the stairs. I require assistance with my ADL's and IADL's. I need help picking out weather appropriate clothing. I cannot be left home alone. I am able to communicate with words. Printed on 12/21/2023 11:09 AM Page 3 of 14 Name :Meredith Grey Effective From : 11/16/2023 Version : 4.00 TABS ID: 654321 Life Plan Type : Annual Status:Finalized I require Range of Scan supervision. I can travel in cars and buses but need full assistance. I do not have money exchange skills however I would like to work on improving my knowledge of money through my work with my Com Hab staff in increasing independent living skills. I enjoy taking walks with my com hab staff. I like to go out to eat in restaurants. I am over eighteen, but I am not a registered voter. I choose to participate in self-directed services since 5/1/2017 to increase my independence and integration at home and in the community.My family and I work with a support broker, Gloria Ollerenshaw and Resource Center for Independent Living (RCIL) to continuously develop, maintain and update my self-direction budget and Staff Action Plan. I would like my mother (Ellis Grey), to be my Designee to manage my Self-Direction budget and services. I would like to access Telehealth, as needed, in order to continue utilizing my self-hired staffing supports and other Self-Direction services. I wish to access my self-directed services both in and out of NYS. My budget allows for community habilitation support staff. My staff helps me to investigate options in community classes as I wish to be a lifelong learner. My staff also helps me to find organization memberships to pursue my interests. When out in the community with my family their mileage is reimbursable through the Personal Use Transportation budget line. When family is not available, my staff provides transportation to all activities. My budget helps my staff cover mileage through the Service Transportation budget line. My staff's admission fees, certain meals and other costs are covered through the Staff Activity budget line when supporting me in activities working on a goal. I use the Clothing budget line to replenish certain items while working on my money exchange skills. I utilize Family Reimbursed Respite as a resource and support in meeting my needs, as well as to provide oversight when my primary caregivers are unavailable. I have IDGS which covers the fees for camp. I receive my broker services via telehealth/ remote methods. I request telehealth services to replace some of my in-person visits. My Care Manager explained to me (my parent or representative, if applicable) that I must be in a private place during our telehealth meeting to ensure that my health information is not accidentally shared with others. My Care Manager let me know that during telehealth visits, my Care Manager and I will both need to be on camera, and we both must be able to hear and see each other. I know that I can change my mind at any time. My Care Manager made clear that even with this request, I can always request in-person meetings any time they are needed. My parents are my legal guardian and my mother is my representative payee. I have GHI insurance. I have Medicaid and receive SSI and SNAP benefits. My Home I live in the suburbs in a split-level home. I am aware of other living arrangements; however, I want to stay with my parents in my home as I have a great quality of life with them. My room is located upstairs, it is decorated with things that interest me. I am unable to dial 911 nor could I report an emergency. There are smoke detectors as well as carbon monoxide detectors on each level located in my home. There is a fire extinguisher too. There are two means of egress from my home. I require verbal prompting to evacuate in case of an emergency. I require Range of Scan supervision while in my home with Com Hab staff and with my family to reduce the likelihood of harm. I have a dog and a cat. I am happy in my home. Let Me Tell You About My Day I maintain an active lifestyle and enjoy staying busy in my community. I spend my day engaging in many activities I enjoy with com hab staff to support me. I enjoy going to the movies, GiGi's Playhouse and to several community classes. I go to an art class, cooking class and participate in a theater program. I take vocal lessons online. While I am at home I enjoy doing puzzles. I have also been taking four mile hikes with my com hab staff to stay fit. I also run a school store at Eagle Elementary School which I use the profits of to donate to my late sister's scholarship fund. I enjoy going to Camp Pa Qua Tuk each year and look forward to going to camp for a week in July and a week in August. While in the community both with my com hab staff and family I require Range of Scan supervision to ensure I am safe. My Health and My Medications My primary developmental disability is intellectual disability. I have diagnoses of ulcerative colitis, Chron's disease, psoriasis and partial trisomy 16 which is a chromosome disorder. I have a history of scoliosis however this was corrected through surgery in 2015. It was discovered that I have malrotation of my intestines, which likely has been present since birth. I had a 2nd colonoscopy in November 2023 which indicates I have Chron's disease and will be discussing options with my gastroenterologist at an upcoming appointment. I have internal hemorrhoids and am frequently constipated. I take Miralax, eat prunes, grapes and raisins to support good bowel health. I receive IV medication every six weeks to treat my Printed on 12/21/2023 11:09 AM Page 4 of 14 Name : Meredith Grey Effective From : Version : 4.00 11/16/2023 TABS ID: 654321 Life Plan Status:Finalized ulcerative colitis along with prescribed daily enemas which my mother gives me. Type : Annual I am fully ambulatory and I use handrails for support when I am walking up and down stairs. I use a shower chair for safety while showering. When I have health concerns, I do not report pain as I have a very high pain tolerance. My family and staff who know me well can observe slight changes in my behavior/ affect and assist in responding to medical concerns as needed. I have seasonal allergies. I do not have any food or medication allergies. However, after a surgical procedure I received oxycodone which I had an extremely negative reaction to. This medication affected my mental status which caused me to display severely unsafe behavior for an extended period of time. Due to this, my parents choose to not consent to oxycodone or any other opioid. My mother makes my medical appointments and takes me to appointments and supports me in advocating. When necessary my Com Hab staff will assist me in attending medical appointments. When I attend dental appointments, I require the use of a papoose to keep me and my providers safe. My com hab staff has also been very helpful in supporting me on dental appointments by helping to reduce my anxiety. My mother gives me my medication and makes sure that my medications are refilled. I take my medications in applesauce and am compliant with all medications. In the event I am hospitalized, I would require a family member to assist me in understanding health care provider directives and to assist me in advocating for myself. My Relationships I have a close relationship with my family. My parents are my biggest supporters and advocates. I have one sister, a brother-in-law and two nephews and a niece who live in Virginia who I enjoy going to visit. I had another sister who unfortunately passed away in 2008. I love spending time with my family and with my friends as well. I also have a close relationship with my support staff that I enjoy working with. I am an extremely friendly and social person; however, it is important that my Range of Scan supervision is maintained as I lack boundaries and safety skills and am at risk of exploitation from strangers. My Happiness I am a very happy young woman who loves socializing and being active in the community. I work with my support staff several times a week and love to explore new activities as well as participate in the activities I love such as art and music class. Currently I am doing a theater class and virtual voice lessons. I enjoy spending time at home playing on my iPad as well as going on road trips with my family. I love going out to eat with my family as well as my support staff. I do not have any behavioral concerns with the exception of lacking community safety skills. My School/ Learning I attended Patchogue-Medford High School until I was 21 years old. I walked with my graduating class in June 2015. However, I attended school until 2017. I took life skills courses.
